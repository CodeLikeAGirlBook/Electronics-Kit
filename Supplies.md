# Finding Supplies for Code Like a Girl
There's a bit of a scavenger hunt involved in finding the materials you'll need. One day, perhaps, there will be a kit with EXACTLY what you need, and when that happens, you'll definitely find the link here. Until thne, I made you some links and lists. 

There are several options for finding these. There may be a store near you that has some of the pieces. Your best bet is online, and some good options are sparkfun.com, adafruit.com, amazon.com. Banggood.com and alibaba.com are possible sites too. , though it may take  longer to get the parts shipped from China. 


## Chapter 2
Option 1: Purchase a Raspberry Pi, a micro-SD card, and scavenge the rest ADD LINKS. Sources are Amazon.com. adafruit.com, sparkfun.com and elsewhere. The current model is 4. The book’s illustrations are of Raspberry Pi 3, and it’s just fine to use this older model; just get one that comes with wifi capability. 


Option 2: Purchase [something like this, which is more expensive but has all the parts you’ll need:](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B06XW6VX1H/ref=asc_df_B06XW6VX1H/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309751315916&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13937989184990486049&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007322&hvtargid=pla-571127897193&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=67183599252&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309751315916&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13937989184990486049&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007322&hvtargid=pla-571127897193)
